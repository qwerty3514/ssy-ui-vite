# .github/workflows/main.yml
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [master] # ✅ 已修正: 将 main 改为 master
  pull_request:
    branches: [master] # ✅ 已修正: 将 main 改为 master

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "Lint"
  Lint:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v3
        with:
          version: 9
      - name: Install modules
        run: pnpm install
      - name: Run Lint
        run: pnpm run lint

  # ✅ 已修正: 修正了缩进，使其与 Lint 平级
  UnitTest:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v3
        with:
          version: 9
      - name: Install modules

        run: pnpm run test # ✅ 已修正: 移除了多余的 "run"

  # ✅ 已修正: 修正了缩进，使其与 Lint, UnitTest 平级
